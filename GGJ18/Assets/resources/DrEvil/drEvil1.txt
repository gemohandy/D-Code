Dear Sir or Madam;
As you have no doubt seen in the news, Dr. Evil has escaped from jail. We probably should not have used the same model of jail cell as the one I escaped from.
He has been sending messages to his cohorts and lackeys. We would like your assistance in decoding them. We're counting on you.
